      <h2>Colonel Sanders | Kentucky Fried Chicken</h2>
      <p>
        Once, there was an older man, who was broke, living in a tiny house and
        owned a beat up car. He was living off of $99 social security checks. At
        65 years of age, he decide things had to change. So he thought about
        what he had to offer. His friends raved about his chicken recipe. He
        decided that this was his best shot at making a change. He left Kentucky
        and traveled to different states to try to sell his recipe. He told
        restaurant owners that he had a mouthwatering chicken recipe. He offered
        the recipe to them for free, just asking for a small percentage on the
        items sold. Sounds like a good deal, right? Unfortunately, not to most
        of the restaurants. He heard NO over 1000 times
        <span class="readmore"
          >Even after all of those rejections, he didnâ€™t give up. He believed
          his chicken recipe was something special. He got rejected 1009 times
          before he heard his first yes. With that one success Colonel Hartland
          Sanders changed the way Americans eat chicken. Kentucky Fried Chicken,
          popularly known as KFC, was born. Remember, never give up and always
          believe in yourself in spite of rejection.
